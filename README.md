Bitburner scripts

I've started playing with Bitburner after I found it on Steam. Since I've never really done that much with javascript, I thought it would give me an context to play around with another language. 

2025-05-29: As of this date, I've completed all the Milestones except for the 'special Augmentation' from Daedalus. I'm guessing the Red Pill-?

2025-06-05: found a node beyond the cave. Discovered a reference to the Enders (O.S. Card be damned). BN-2 > and now Hack = 1

2025-07-04: added a tree script to crawl the network and build a network tree recursively, and new versions of a start up script, the last of which uses the tree function. Otherwise leveling up a gang and waiting for hacking to hit 15000 - currently, almost at 2k.

2025-08-23: after "playing" for 10 or 15 minutes every now and again - because the game progresses so slowly - I'm beginning to wonder if this is really worth the effort. Added runHack.js to get the "Need more real life ram" achievement where you have to run 1000 scripts simultaneously - also to increase the Hack rate to get out of the current node.
